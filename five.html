                Bipolar disorder is sometimes regarded as a disorder of no significance when compared to the main illnesses 
                such as depression and anxiety. However, it is an extreme illness that consists of extreme mood swings , 
                including manic (high energy) and depressive (low energy) episodes. These swings in one's feelings can greatly 
                affect the completion of daily activities.

                            Manic Episodes: Common Signs of Manic episodes include elevated mood or irritability. This is the 
                            part of the mood swing where people feel lots of energy and begin to take dangerous risks as well. 
                            Rapid speech and racing thoughts are common symptoms of people being in such episodes.

                            Depressive Episodes: This can be thought of the opposite of Manic Episodes, or the low part of the
                             mood swing. These episodes almost always have extremely depressing thoughts, and low energy which 
                             impedes daily activities. Some other signs of these episodes include inability ot concentrate, and 
                             sometimes even drastic thoughts about death and/or suicide.

                            Genetics And Brain structure: A strong family history of bipolar disorder or other mood disorders 
                            may increase the chance of yourself suffering from one of these disorders. In addition, certain 
                            abnormalities in brain areas that regulate mood and behavior can lead to the sudden mood swings 
                            so often found in patients with bipolar disorder.

                            Psychotherapy and Medication: Of course, different types of medication can be prescribed to reduce 
                            the effects of bipolar disorder. This includes mood stabilizers (ex: lithium), antipsychotics 
                            (ex: quetiapine), and antidepressants. Medication adherence is crucial for managing symptoms that 
                            otherwise would have significant impacts on your lifestyle. As always, CBT and psychoeducation help 
                            individuals understand their condition, recognize early signs of mood changes, and develop coping 
                            strategies.

                            Lifestyle Changes: To better combat the symptoms of bipolar disorder, a better management of sleep 
                            and avoidance of drugs is recommended. In addition, routine medical check ups are beneficial along 
                            with check ins with family members (used as a support group in some cases)
