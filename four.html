                Eating disorders are serious conditions related to persistent eating behaviors that negatively impact health, emotions, 
                and the ability to function in important areas of life. Common types include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and 
                binge-eating disorder. There is a common myth surrounding eating disorders that it only deals with obesity or extreme 
                anorexia, but there are many other disorders that people suffer from.

                            sense of fear, but symptoms include neglecting the severity of not eating the right amount of food.
