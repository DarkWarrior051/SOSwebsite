            <p class="mainText">Depression is a serious mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness,
                and a lack of interest or pleasure in previously enjoyed activities. It affects how teenagers think, feel, and handle
                daily activities, including sleeping, eating, and working. As mentioned before, to truly understand some of these 
                mental illnesses affecting students and adults around the world, it is important to realize the Three C’s.

                        Common Signs — There are multiple common signs for those suffering from any type of Depression. It is easier to 
                        realize if you have a specific common sign, by looking at the different groups of symptoms commonly found in patients
                        with depression. 
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Emotional Symptoms: These are the signs that are affecting any one of your multiple emotions frequently throughout 
                            your day. Common signs of these symptoms usually include feelings of hopelessness or pessimism. Constant negative 
                            thoughts whether it is about yourself or peers, are usually not a good sign and could detrimental affect one's overall 
                            well-being. Similarly, feelings of guilt and worthlessness are two huge common feelings that start to fill up one's 
                            emotional tank. Many suffering from depression start to realize that they are having thoughts of immense regret, or 
                            thoughts about their own  worth in society persistently throughout their days.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cognitive Symptoms: These signs are more related to acquiring knowledge or understanding different experiences.Some 
                            cognitive symptoms that may be related to depression include difficulty concentrating in class, extreme difficulty in 
                            making decisions, and even thoughts of suicide. Again, difficulty of concentration or making decisions is normally put
                            to the extreme in these cases, where some people feel that every decision they make will have extreme negative 
                            consequences.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Physical Symptoms: Not all common signs of depression affect your mentality. Some of the most harmful symptoms affect 
                            your physical body, such as loss of appetite, sleep disturbances and extreme fatigue during times where you normally 
                            were full of energy and life.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Behavioral Symptoms: The last group of common signs of depression include those that start to affect your previous 
                            behavior. These symptoms include loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, social withdrawal, and reduced 
                            participation in activities that you once enjoyed greatly. Any drastic change in one's behavior is usually a good 
                            sign of some sort of mental illness affecting their emotions, which in turn affects the activities they start to 
                            carry out throughout the day.

                    <p>
                        Causes: Similarly to common signs of these illnesses, splitting up the causes in different groups will help you understand 
                        which events are aiding in the expansion of depressed feelings. These causes are sometimes unavoidable, whilst others may
                        be avoided with the right outlook and approach.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Genetic Factors and Brain Chemistry: Family members with depression increase your possibility of having depression. 
                            In some cases, different chemicals start to alter your body and emotions, displaying symptoms of depression. For 
                            example, imbalances in neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine are associated with depression.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Environmental Stressors: Traumatic events or experiences in one's childhood are deeply associated with depression found 
                            in some people. Even major life changes, such as a divorce or moving homes can greatly affect someone's mood, leading to 
                            depression.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Psychological Factors and Medical conditions: Low self-esteem, negative thinking patterns, and perfectionism contribute
                            to the development of depression. These consistent thoughts only help depression overrun your brain and body. In addition, 
                            chronic illnesses, hormonal changes, and certain medications can contribute to depression. Although some of these changes 
                            are unavoidable, it is beneficial to understand that this may be a leading cause in your feelings of depression.
                        </li>

                        Combat (Treatment): Now that you understand the signs and causes of this illness, combatting it is the next step to success. 
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Psychotherapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) are effective in treating depression. CBT 
                            focuses on changing negative thought patterns, while IPT addresses relationship issues and social functioning. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Medication: Antidepressants, such as SSRIs (ex: Prozac, Zoloft) and SNRIs (ex: Effexor, Cymbalta), are commonly prescribed. 
                            In some cases, atypical antidepressants or tricyclic antidepressants may be used.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Support Groups and Lifestyle Changes: Expressing your feelings to those who are experiencing the same issue is a great
                             mental treatment for some people. Participating in support groups will allow you to not only get these thoughts out of 
                             your head, but also pick up some tips from other members. Additionally, engaging in activities that bring joy and 
                             fulfillment can help improve mood, along with improving your diet and making sure sufficient sleep is achieved every night.
