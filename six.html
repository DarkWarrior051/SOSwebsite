                    OCD is characterized by unwanted, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) performed 
                    to alleviate the distress caused by these thoughts. It can severely impact daily life and functioning. OCD is another 
                    disorder that is glossed over by many people, and its significance is not truly understood.

                        Common Signs: These symptoms may be found in daily activities and feelings that some people start to experience.
                    </p>

                            Obsession: Common symptoms of OCD include recurring feelings of obsession over daily activities. Some people 
                            tend to obsess over the execution of some activities for example, or the immense feeling that a certain object 
                            needs to be in symmetrical order. Any of these thoughts of urges may cause extreme anxiety if not done correctly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Compulsion: Compulsions can be thought of as certain activities that are done in order to rescue one's anxiety. 
                            This includes examples such as washing your hands a specific way or even arranging things in a certain order.

                            Impact: If you start to realize that you experience one of the symptoms above, try and figure out whether or not 
                            these symptoms start to have significant impacts on your social or physician lifestyle.

                            Genetics, brain, Environment: Same as above disorders, although some differences in brain areas related to behavior 
                            regulation, such as the orbitofrontal cortex and basal ganglia are associated with OCD.

                            Medication: There are different types of medicine available to people experiencing OCD and its harmful symptoms. 
                            SSRIs (ex: fluoxetine, sertraline) are commonly prescribed to manage symptoms.

                            Psychotherapy: A common theme among these disorders is the treatment dealing with psychotherapy. As mentioned 
                            above, and related to OCD, CBT, particularly exposure and response prevention (ERP), is effective in reducing 
                            symptoms. ERP involves gradually exposing individuals to anxiety-provoking situations and preventing the compulsive 
                            response. This gradual revelation will help people build a response to these situations, hoping that they will not 
                            feel any sort of anxiety after building up a feeling of immunity to these situations.
