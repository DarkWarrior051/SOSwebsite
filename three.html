                ADHD is a chronic condition marked by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with 
                functioning or development. It is often diagnosed in childhood and can continue into adolescence and adulthood. It usually 
                has a significant impact on one's learning and understanding especially in school environments.

                        Common Signs: Include pics

                        <li>
                            Inattention: As mentioned before, some common signs can be viewed in the classroom. Especially when students have 
                            difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities and have difficulty paying attention for an extended 
                            period of time. In addition, symptoms include being easily distracted by extraneous stimuli and also experiencing 
                            extreme forgetfulness in daily activities.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Hyperactivity: There are numerous physical symptoms of this order as well. This consist of fidgeting with hands or 
                            feet and impulse to start leaving seats in situations when remaining seated is expected

                        Causes: Environments and Genetics are the main factors that lead to the build up of this disorder in many adolescents.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Genetics: ADHD tends to run in families, displaying how it may be passed down from generation to generation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Environmental Factors: Exposure to environmental toxins (ex: lead) during pregnancy or at a young age, prenatal 
                            exposure to alcohol or tobacco smoke, premature birth, and low birth weight. These factors happen at very young 
                            ages, and are often told to many parents as a warning to not indulge in some activities while pregnant.
                        </li>

                        Combat (Treatment): Most of the treatment of this disorder complies with the various treatments mentioned before, with 
                        the addition of a few specific others.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Medication: Stimulants (ex: methylphenidate, amphetamine salts) are the most common and effective treatments for 
                            ADHD. Non-stimulant medications (ex: atomoxetine, guanfacine) may also be prescribed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Educational Support And Parental training: Different Educational Programs such as IEPs and 504 plans help aid kids 
                            in controlling their impulses and examples of hyperactivities. The household is where these common impulses sometimes
                            originate from, thus parents being educated on how to manage their child's behavior and include certain disciplinary 
                            strategies is very beneficial.
                        </li>

                            Behavioural Therapy and Lifestyle Changes are obvious treatments for ADHD, and for more information, please refer to 
                            the previous pages about Anxiety Disorders and Depression.
