                            anxiety disorder include situations where you feel nervous of being judged around certain groups of people, to

                        Causes: Different events and/or experiences lead to the feelings of worry and fear. Sometimes, recurring events
                        start to build up these emotions to the point where you may actually be suffering from one of the previously 
                        mentioned disorders.

                            Stressful Life Events: These events may sometimes look like nothing to the common bystander, but may have 
                            significant value to different people. This includes academic pressure and family issues.
                        </li>

                            Genetic Factors And brain chemistry: These factors are common when analyzing causes of different mental health
                            illnesses. Family history of anxiety disorders sometimes increase your chance of suffering from the same disorders, 
                            and different brain chemicals may affect your overall brain chemistry such as imbalances in neurotransmitters like 
                            serotonin and dopamine.

                        Combat (Treatment): Different treatments can be used to combat anxiety disorders, and the effectiveness of each 
                        treatment is going to differ for each person, so don't be discouraged if one doesn't work out for you.

                            Psychotherapy and Medication: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in helping teens identify and change 
                            negative thought patterns and behaviors. Exposure therapy, a component of CBT, gradually exposes individuals to 
                            nxiety-provoking situations to reduce fear. In addition, certain medications may also be of use to reduce feelings 
                            of extreme fear. To illustrate, SSRIs (ex: Zoloft, Prozac) and benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed to manage 
                            anxiety symptoms
                        </li>

                            Lab tests: Although not as often used, these lab tests can be used to find out other medical disorders that may be 
                            leading to the expansion of anxiety disorders.
                        </li>

                            Support Groups: As always, expressing your feelings usually helps people let loose, and avoid holding on to many 
                            negative thoughts which in the long run could psychologically affect you greatly. To exemplify, engaging with 
                            trusted friends, family, or mental health professionals provides emotional support and practical advice.
